Automatic removal of non-substantive segments from podcasts using machine learning techniques


With the growing popularity of streaming applications, podcasts are becoming an increasingly common form of audio content consumption. Listeners can engage with conversations from their favorite creators and explore various topics from virtually anywhere. However, in many cases, recordings contain unclear or non-substantive segments, which negatively impact the listening experience. The aim of this study is to design a tool and develop a model that enables the elimination of non-substantive segments in podcast recordings. Such a solution can significantly accelerate the post-production process by automating the detection and removal of unnecessary content. Additionally, as part of this work, a subtitle generator for video materials has been developed, allowing for the identification and marking of moments of unclear speech. This facilitates a faster detection of problematic segments in recordings. This study discusses the application of convolutional networks in audio signal processing and provides an introduction to machine learning. It also details the dataset and the steps taken to prepare it for the model training process. The designed model, which serves as a foundation for future tools, is presented. Finally, the study focuses on the research results, evaluation of the model's effectiveness, and the presentation of the final outcomes.
